         Another member of the eclectic cast of Apex Legends heroes, Elliot Witt distinguishes himself by emphasising stealth tactics over out-and-out physical prowess. Someone who likes to out-Witt his opponents, if you will

         Once a scientist named Alexander Nox who worked for the Frontier’s leading pesticide gases manufacturer, he would be changed irrevocably after deciding to test a stronger formula on himself. Each to their own. But, for that unfortunate reason, Caustic is a tank of an Apex Legends character, and he’s is built around poison and gas attacks.

         Don’t be fooled, despite her rugged exterior and military precision, Anita Williams has a more noble cause for entering the Apex Games. Separated from her family during a military mission, she’s raising the funds to fight her way back.

         Lucario is a playable character in the Brawl mod Project M. Its mechanics between Brawl and Project M have been nearly entirely reimagined.
         Lucario ranks 18th out of 41 on the official tier list, toward the top of the B tier. This is a considerable drop from their placement in Brawl, where it was 11th out of 38.

         Bloodhound

      <p>
         The identity of Bloodhound is unknown. Rumours range from the crow-clad hunter being fabulously wealthy to living the life of a slave in a past life.
         Regardless, Bloodhound is known as the technological tracker, stemming from its hunter playstyle. If you love the thrill of the hunt and are keen to take to the Outlands to eliminate your prey, then the Bloodhound may be for you.

         Ajay Che is a healer with a heavy conscience. Once part of a family of wealthy war profiteers, Che left once she truly realised the extent of her kin’s repugnant business.
         Her loadout reflects that desire to heal and repair the damage done by her family: all of Che’s winnings from the Apex Games go towards good causes.

         Gibraltar
      </p>
      <p>
         Gibraltar likes to protect people as much as he likes to bring the pain. He’s known as the wild, but gentle giant for good reason: his father lost an arm saving him and his boyfriend from mudslide after the pair stole his bike and went joy riding.
         This Apex Legends character is a tank whose sense of responsibility and protection to atone for his mistakes is unmistakable.

         Pathfinder is forward in his thinking as well as in what he says. Apparently, he booted up over a decade ago in an abandoned laboratory and has been on the lookout for his creator ever since.
         Pathfinder is a medic, but his kit differs from Lifeline in the sense that it’s intended to help you explore and traverse terrain, rather than to heal.
